# Star Trek Game: Vulcans and Klingons

This is a simple game based on the old bulls and cows game, which was a precursor to the game "Mastermind" that many of us old people played in the 1980's when we were kids. It is also a precursor to the game of Wordle.

In this game, four unique random integers are chosen (representing ships from Star Trek), and you have up to ten guesses to get the ships (digits) in the correct order. If you get a correct ship in the wrong order, you get a klingon. If you get a correct ship in the correct location, you get a vulcan. Par for this game is 7 guesses. You might be able to get it faster! It is only logical!

You can access the game at http://meadpoint.net/startrekgame or you can download the files and run it locally. Feel free to fork and play around with it. Make your own version with your own graphics. There is no framework, it is just basic HTML, CSS and plain vanilla JavaScript.

The game is designed to work fairly well on both mobile devices and desktop browsers.
